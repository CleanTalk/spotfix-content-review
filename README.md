## Description

### Highlight → Ask → Resolve

SpotFix is a lightweight on-page widget that makes it easy for visitors, editors, writers, and team members to submit feedback directly in the context of your website's content. It's especially useful for proofreading, spell checking, and fixing outdated or unclear information, because corrections are tied to the exact place where the issue appears.

A visitor simply highlights a piece of text or an element on the page. When they do, a compact widget appears in the bottom-right corner, allowing them to submit a **Spot** — a short request, correction suggestion, or question attached to the precise content location. No need to describe where the problem is — the widget knows automatically.

Submitting a Spot takes less than 10 seconds. The widget auto-fills the title using the highlighted text or an image's Title/Alt attribute. The visitor adds a short message, optionally includes their name and email, while the page URL and element reference are captured automatically.

Each Spot becomes a task in doBoard, where your team can track progress, assign responsibility, add labels, and set due dates. The referenced element on the page is highlighted, making content review and corrections extremely straightforward. This greatly reduces miscommunication — especially compared to email feedback or team chat screenshots.

You can reply to Spots from doBoard or directly within the widget. Conversations appear as a chat thread with visible progress and status updates. If the visitor shared an email, they'll be notified when you reply.

When collapsed, the SpotFix icon shows how many Spots exist on the current page and across the site. One click reveals the list and instantly highlights all linked elements.

## Why Does SpotFix Work?

SpotFix turns proofreading and feedback into structured, actionable improvements. No more chasing context. No more messy email chains. Just: **Highlight → Ask → Resolve**.
